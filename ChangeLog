- Note : Because of various internal modifications, this is intended to be a beta
         release. So it's possible that KImageMapEditor may crash and/or
         the content of the currently editing html file could be corrupted
         or be lost at all.
         KImageMapEditor therefore creates a backup file everytime you
         save an html file. It ends with a ~.
         Please only delete this file if you are sure that the original file
         isn't corrupted.
- New features :
  * Converted the program to the KPart architecture, it can now be used as a
    imagemap viewer plugin in Konqueror or as an edit plugin in Quanta.
  * It's now possible to really edit a html file instead of creating always
    a new one with only one imagemap.
  * Added a listview of all imagemaps of the current editing html files.
    It's now possible to switch between the different maps, to delete maps and
    to add new maps to the html file.
  * Added a listview of all images that are contained in the current html file.
    It's now possible to switch between these images.
  * Spanish translation - Thanks to Antonio Crevillén
- Bug fixes :
  * When KImageMapEditor was not properly installed with make install and
    the required image files couldn't be found, KImageMapEditor now shows
    an error message and exit(1), instead of crashing.
